Base:
Read file using Files.readAllLines
Input contents of file into List
Calls for Sort.Combiner (Edited code from previous example).
After it spreads them into list call for Sort.Frequency
Now Export


Sort.Combiner:
Goes through a for loop that iterates through until end of the list.
Goes through another for loop that iterates through each character until end of length
If this is the last word (end of length) check when last space was. Add substring from
the next char after space to end (added to array).
If it is not a space add each letter to a current string.
When it reaches a space add string to array.

Sort.Frequency
Create Hashmap
Iterate through the size of list.
If Hashmap does not contain key already (first time word is being added)
    - Add the key with a value of one
If the key is contained already
    - Add one to the value of the key
Create a treemap and put contents into treemap
    -This calls Compare

Compare
This does a sort going through all of the treemap.

Export:
Iterate using a for loop through the Treemap (for all keys in that order)
Take a stars method and use a for loop until value of key is reached adding stars to
a string.
Print the Key and stars next to it.
