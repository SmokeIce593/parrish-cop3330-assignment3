Base:
Read file using Files.readAllLines
Input contents of file into List

Sort:
Siphon through each line from list , is the delimiter (Double for loop i for names j for characters
Characters check for ,
Add each character to a string and when it reaches , add string not including comma (comma location - 1)
Using the delimiter adding each parameter to list
If it's the second comma (Where it would be the numbers) take the substring of the value after the space to the end

Table:
Get max string length for each section. Compare each set of values (for loop i = i+3) and if current > max max = current
When going through output add spaces to each one based on the max of the set value - size of the current word +
Add a set number of spaces after each (3)

For the spaces for the beginning of the table:
Spaces between last and first is max length last + space last â€“ 4
Spaces between first and salary is max length first + space first -5
Then Salary (Don't really need spaces here at end)
Convert the max number of spaces max first +3 max last +3 max salary +3
Then get number of dashes using the max number of spaces. Use a for loop to create each dash for the length of the max
spaces.
