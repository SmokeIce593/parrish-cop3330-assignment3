Base:
Get input from scanner.
Navigate to parser.
After parsing some of the information we need to check and see if the object is now null.
-	If it is not null, just return it.
-	If it is null use a while loop and wait until a successful choose is picked.
Then output the object information.

Output:
Get json “name” “price” and “quantity” and convert them into strings. Print them.
For name json weirdly keeps quotes around name so grab substring of 1st index and string.length() -1.
Parser:
Using file reader and a json parser make the json file into an object.
Convert the object into a Json object and turn this into an array buy getting products.
Using Iterator attribute use, a while loop and iterate through until it does not have a next to go to.
-	If found return the object with the same name as the input
-	If not return null
